<h2> Class Features </h2>
<dl>
	<dt>Horde</dt><dd>Peasants only act as a unit on the skirmish combat tables, even if everyone else is engaged in man-to-man melee, and even if there is only a single peasant in the levie.  All peasants controlled by a player must form up within at most two separate units.</dd>
	<dt>Reluctant Soldiers</dt><dd>Each unit of peasants in the player's control must pass a morale check at the beginning of each round of combat.  If failed, that unit does not act that round.  If attacked, will fall back or flee.</dd>
	<dt> Squire </dt><dd>A single peasant may accompany a knight, and automatically becomes the knight's squire.  Squires do not do anything beyond carry their knight's equipment and help into and out of armor, though may occasionally engage in combat when threatened.</dd>
