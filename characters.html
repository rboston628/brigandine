<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<p>
Player character creation works as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> If points remain in point budget, player elects to make a new charater. </li>
	<li> Player rolls core stats, 4d2 in order: ATK, AIM, DEF, IQ. </li>
	<li> Player picks class, within point budget. </li>
	<li> From class features, make note of this PC's class stats: &#35;attk. &#35;def, etc.</li>
	<li> If points remain, create additional PC(s) as above. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The above steps may occur in any order that makes sense.
</p><p>
Once a player's point budget is met, he may no longer elect new PCs.
</p><p>
The meaning of these terms will be explained in what follows.
</p>

<h2 id="point-values"> Point Values </h2>
<p>
All player characters in the game have an assigned point-value.  This originates from the wargame roots.  To create balanced armies in a war game, each side would be assigned a certain number of points, and each troop type a certain point value.  The competitors would construct their armies within the point budgets.
</p><p>
For Brigandine, each player has a <b>point budget of 12</b>.
</p><p>
Players are allowed to (and inded encouraged to) control more than one character, provided the total point value of all PCs does not exceed the point budget of 12.
</p><p>
Whenever a player loses a PC, the player regains those points.  Players may also voluntarily drop a PC from their control, also freeing those points.  These points may be used at a later (reasonable) time to attempt to recruit additional characters, within the point budget. 
</p><p>
PCs who are dropped from control are assumed to be exhausted from adventuring, and will not assist in either exploration or battle.  They <b>will</b> assist in depleting rations, as they still require upkeep until they can return to town.  As soon as reasonably possible, these former PCs will return to civilization and remain there.  They can rejoin the party later, if desired, by swapping them back in.
</p><p>
Through continued play, the players may build up a "stable" of PCs residing in some basecamp area (such as town, or a fortress controlled by the PCs), all of whom can be swapped in, out, and between players as needed, within the limits of the point budget.
</p><p>
Even though players are working cooperatively, no player should use his point budget to buy PCs that are controlled by another player.  This defeats the play dimension of choosing a good mix of character types.
</p>


<h2 id="class-list"> Character Classes </h2>
<p>
Below are the available character classes, along with their point-buy values.  Each will be explained separately.
</p>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="classes/knight.html"> The Knight </a> (10) </li>
	<li> <a href="classes/infantryman.html">The Infantryman </a> (4) </li>
	<li> <a href="classes/longbowman.html"> The English Longbowman </a> (8) </li>
	<li> The Artillerist (6) </li>
	<li> The Scout (3) </li>
	<li> <a href="classes/peasant.html"> Peasant Levie </a> (1 each) </li>
</ul>
Character class determines the type of arms and armor that can be used, how effectively the PC can attack, how many blows in combat the player can survive, and any other special abilities.

<h2 id="stats-and-dice"> Character Stats</h2>

<h3 id="level"> Character Level</h3>
<p>
As characters continue to adventure, they gain battlefield experience.  As they continue gaining experience, they will fight with greater ferocity, become more impervious to blows, or otherwise increase in effectiveness.  All PCs begin at 1st level, but gradually progress.  Character classes have a max level, after which they stop improving.
</p>


<h3 id="stats"> Core stats: ATK, AIM, DEF, IQ, etc. </h3>
<p>
In most RPGs, a character has a certain set of "stats", usually in the range 3-18 by rolling 3d6 in order (or in modern games through point buys and standard arrays).  These stats 3-18 correspond to bonuses from -3 to +3.
</p><p>
In Brigandine your "stat" is a die, usually a d6, and is generated by rolling 4d2, in order.  The stat is the die that has that many sides.  Any time the game requires rolling dice to resolve a situation, you will roll the dice corresponding to one of your stats.  The principal stats are:
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><dl>
	<dt> ATK </dt><dd> Attack, representing physical ability and prowess.  Almost always the die rolled in melee combat.</dd>
	<dt> AIM </dt><dd> Aim, representing the ability to target individuals. This accounts for good eyesight and hand-eye coordination.  Against very small opponents, the AIM die must be used instead of ATK die.</dd>
	<dt> DEF </dt><dd> Defense, representing ability to avoid or withstand damage.  Can be rolled during an attack to parry an opponent's blow.</dd>
	<dt> IQ </dt><dd> Intelligence, representing mental ability and ease of solving technical problems. Includes perspicaciousness, alertness, and ease of noticing details.</dd>
</dl></td>
<td>
<svg width="270" height="260">
	<polygon points="10,240 10,220 60,220 60,140 110,140 110,20 160,20 160,140 210,140 210,220 260,220 260,240" style="fill:lightgray;stroke:black"/>

<p>
The exact order of these stats on the character sheet is not important, but the order they will be rolled must be written down before rolling.
</p><p>
If your play group does not have the special dice, the referee is free to set any other dice, as convenient.
</p>

<h4> Taking d6 </h4>
<p>
If a player so chooses, and <b>before</b> rolling any dice for stats, the player may elect to simply take d6 in a stat.
</p>

<h3 id="hits"> Class stats: &#35;attk, &#35;def, attk type, def type, morale </h3>
<p>
As in most other RPGs, the principal stats are not the only relevant numbers for a PC.  There are other factors which determine the ability of a PC, in particular in combat.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt> type attk </dt>
	<dd> The classification of the character in melee attacks: LF, MF, HF, LC, MC, HC.  This is necessary for determining how many attacks the character receives.  The value is determined by class and equipped weapon. </dd>
	<dt> type def </dt>
	<dd> The classification of the character in melee defense: LF, MF, HF, LC, MC, HC.  This is also necessary for determining how many dice the character's attacker receives.  The value is determined by class and worn armor. </dd>
	<dt> &#35;attk </dt>
	<dd> For a powerful warrior who fights with the strength of several men; this characterizes exactly how many men he fights with the strength of.  If 1, fight as single man; if 2, fight as 2 men; etc.  Is necessary for determining how many dice to roll on skirmish combat.  The value is determined by class and level.  Will be listed with type attk as, e.g. <b>attk 2LF</b> for types which attack as 2 light foot.</dd>
	<dt> &#35;def </dt>
	<dd> For a stalwart champion who shrugs off enemy blows to fight on; this characterizes exactly how many times he may be struck before dying.  Decreases with each successful enemy hit ("taking damage").  When the character has taken cumulative hits equal to this number, the character is defeated in combat.  The terms "<b>hits</b>" or "hits remaining" may be used interchangeably.  This value is determined by class and level.  Will be listed with type def as, e.g. <b>def 1HC</b> for types which defend as 1 heavy cavalry.</dd>
	<dt> simul. </dt>
	<dd> The number of simulataneous hits (i.e. in same combat phase) needed for the character to take damage; if the character takes fewer hits than this, no damage is received; if the character takes this many or more hits, only then does he take damage.  E.g. if the figure has 4 hits and simul. of 2: if in melee he takes 1 hit, then he does not take damage; if he takes 2 hits, then he is damaged for 2 with 2 hits remaining; if he takes 3 hits, then he is damaged for 3 with 1 hit remaining; if he takes 4 hits, then he is damageed for 4 and is defeated.  This value is determined by class and level.  When different from 1, will be listed togther with type def and &#35;def as, e.g. <b>def 4HF/4</b>, for a type which defends as 4 heavy foot, requiring 4 simulataneous hits to be damaged.</dd>
	<dt> morale </dt>
	<dd> The willingness and resolve of the character to fight on in the face of near-certain death.  On a morale check, a character must score over or above this score on 2d6 to continue fighting.  Determined by class and level. </dd>
	<dt> &#35;firing </dt>
	<dd> A measurement of how capable the character is at missile fire. </dd>
	<dt> &half;mv</dt>
	<dd>How far the character can move in a single movement phase of combat.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In any combat, it is necessary to know:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> type attk and type def</li>
	<li> &#35;attk and &#35;def (and simul. where applicable) </li>
</ul>
<p>
which will be listed, e.g. attk 2HF, def 3LC, for short.
These are determined by class, level, and equipment worn: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li> class (type and &#35;)</li>
	<li> level (&#35;)</li>
	<li> equipment (type)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="FC-stat">Fantasy Combat Type (FC)</h3>
<p>
Some creatures (such as dragons or demons) are exceptionally powerful, and can only be vanquished using the Fantasy Combat rules.  Certain character classes are able to advance onto the Fantasy Combat tables, and if so are given an FC type.  This only occurs for certain classes and at higher levels.
