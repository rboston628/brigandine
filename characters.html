<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<p>
Player character creation works as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Select character class for PC(s), up to point maximum </li>
	<li> For each PC, roll stats ATK, AIM, IQ, etc. </li>
	<li> For each PC, from class features, make note of &#35;attk. &#35;def, etc.</li>
	<li> If points remain, select additional PC(s) as above. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Altneratively, players  could be allowed to roll stats first, then select a class.
</p><p>
The meaning of these terms will be explained in what follows.
</p>

<h2 id="point-values"> Point Values </h2>
<p>
All characters in the game have an assigned point-value.  This originates from the war game roots.  To create balanced armies in a war game, each side would be assigned a certain number of points, and each troop type a certain point value.  The competitors would construct their armies within the point budgets.
</p><p>
For Brigandine, each player has a <b>point budget of 5</b>.
</p><p>
Players are allowed to (and inded encouraged to) control more than one character, provided the total point value of all PCs does not exceed 5.
</p><p>
Whenever a player loses a PC, the player regains those points, which can be used at a later (reasonable) time to attempt to recruit additional characters, assuming the player's total point value does not exceed 5. 
</p><p>
Players may also voluntarily drop a PC from their control at any time, freeing those points for a potential new recruit.  The player can swap out PCs in this way, provided the total point value for the player does not exceed 5.  PCs swapped out of the party in this way are assumed to be exhausted from their time adventuring, and will not assist in either exploration or battle.  They <b>will</b> assist in depleting rations, as they still require upkeep until they can return to town.  As soon as reasonably possible, any PC not controlled by a player will return to civilization and remain there conducting business relevant only to himself.  They can rejoin the party later, if desired, by swapping them back in.
</p><p>
It is possible for the players to create a "stable" of PCs residing in some base camp area (either a particular town, a war camp, a fortress controlled by the PCs), who can be swapped in, out, and between players as needed for the circumstance.  None of these PCs will leave the base camp if not counting against a player's point value total.
</p><p>
Even though players are working cooperatively, no player should use his point value total to buy PCs that are controlled by another player.  This defeats the play strategy of allocating points across different character types.
</p>


<h2 id="class-list"> Character Classes </h2>
<p>
Below are the available character classes, along with their point-buy values.  Each will be explained separately.
</p>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="classes/knight.html"> The Knight </a> (4&#189;) </li>
	<li> The Soldier (2) </li>
	<li> <a href="classes/yeoman.html"> The English Longbowman </a> (3) </li>
	<li> The Artillerist (4) </li>
	<li> The Scout (1) </li>
	<li> <a href="classes/peasant.html"> Peasant Levie </a> (&#189; each) </li>
</ul>
Character class determines the type of arms and armor that can be used, how effectively the PC can attack, how many times the player can be struck in combat, and any other special abilities.


<h2 id="stats-and-dice"> Character Stats</h2>

<h3 id="stats"> Core stats: ATK, AIM, DEF, IQ, etc. </h3>
<p>In most RPGs, a character has a certain set of "stats", usually in the range 3-18 by rolling 3d6 in order.  These stats then correspond to bonuses from -3 to +3.
</p><p>
In Brigandine your "stat" is a die, usually a d6, and is generated by rolling 4d2, in order.  The stat is the die that has that many sides.  Any time the game requires rolling dice to resolve a situation, you will roll the dice corresponding to one of your stats.  The principal stats are:
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td>
<dl>
	<dt> ATK </dt><dd> Attack, representing physical ability and prowess.  Almost always the die rolled in melee combat.</dd>
	<dt> AIM </dt><dd> Aim, representing the ability to target individuals. This accounts for good eyesight and hand-eye coordination.  Against very small opponents, the AIM die must be used instead of ATK die.</dd>
	<dt> DEF </dt><dd> Defense, representing ability to avoid or withstand damage.  Can be rolled during an attack to parry an opponent's blow.</dd>
	<dt> IQ </dt><dd> Intelligence, representing mental ability and ease of solving technical problems. </dd>
</dl>
		</td>

<p>
The exact order of these stats on the character sheet is not important, but they must be rolled in the order they appear on the character sheet, and this order fixed before rolling.
</p>

<h4> Taking d6 </h4>
<p>
If a player so chooses, and <b>before</b> rolling any dice for stats, the player may elect to simply take d6 in each stat.
</p>

<h3 id="hits"> Class stats: &#35;attk, &#35;def, attk type, def type, morale </h3>
<p>
As in most other RPGs, the principal stats are the not the only numerical categorizations of a PC.  There are other factors which determine the ability of a PC, in particular in combat.
</p>
<dl>
	<!--dt> hits </dt><dd> A measurement of the toughness of the character, in terms of the number of times the character may survive being struck by an otherwise lethal blow.  For normal people, this is always 1.  The value is determined by class and level.</dd-->
	<dt> &#35;attk </dt><dd> For a powerful warrios who fights with the strength of several men; this characterizes exactly how many men he fights with the strength of.  If 1, fight as single man; if 2, fight as 2 men; etc.  Is necessary for determining how many dice to roll on skirmish combat.  The value is determined by class and level.</dd>
	<dt> &#35;def </dt><dd> A measurement of the toughness of the character, in terms of the number of times the character may survive being struck by an otherwise lethal blow.  For normal people, this is always 1.  The value is determined by class and level.</dd>
	<dt> type attk </dt><dd> The type of soldier that the character is classified as in melee attacks: LF, MF, HF, LC, MC, HC.  This is also necessary for determining how many dice to roll on skirmish combat.  The value is determined by class and equipped weapon.</dd>
	<dt> type def</dt><dd> The type of soldier that the character is classified as in melee defense: LF, MF, HF, LC, MC, HC.  This is also necessary for determining how many dice to roll on skirmish combat.  The value is determined by class and worn armor class.</dd>
	<dt> morale</dt><dd> The willingness and resolve of the character to fight on.  On a morale check, a character must score over or above this score on 2d6 to continue fighting.  Rarely checked for PCs.  Determined by class and level.</dd>
	<dt> &#35;firing</dt><dd> A measurement of how adept the character is at archery </dd>
</dl>

<p>
In any combat, it is necessary to know:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> type attk and type def</li>
	<li> &#35;attk and &#35;def </li>
</ul>
<p>
which are all determined by class, level, and equipment worn: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li> class (type and &#35;)</li>
	<li> level (&#35;)</li>
	<li> equipment (type)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fantasy Combat Type (FC)</h3>
<p>
Some creatures are exceptionally powerful, and can only be vanquished using the Fantasy Combat rules.  Certain character classes are able to advance onto the Fantasy Combat tables, and if so are given a FC type.  This only occurs for certain classes and at higher levels.
