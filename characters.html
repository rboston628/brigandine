<h1>Character Creation</h1>
<p>
Character creation works as follows:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> Select character class for PC(s), up to point maximum </li>
	<li> For each PC, roll stats ATK, AIM, IQ, etc. </li>
	<li> For each PC, from class features, make note of &#35;attk. &#35;def, etc.</li>
	<li> If points remain, select additional PC(s) as above. </li>
</ul>
<p>
Altneratively, players  could be allowed to roll stats first, then select a class.
</p><p>
The meaning of these terms will be explained in what follows.
</p>

<h2 id="class-list"> Character Classes </h2>
<p>
Below are the available character classes, along withtheir point-buy values.  Each will be explained separately.
</p>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="classes/knight.html">The Knight</a> (4&#189;) </li>
	<li> The Soldier (2) </li>
	<li> <a href="classes/yeoman.html"> The Longbowman </a> (3) </li>
	<li> The Artillerist (4) </li>
	<li> The Scout (1) </li>
	<li> <a href="classes/peasant.html">Peasant Levie</a> (&#189; each) </li>
	<li> <a href="classes/dog.html"> Dog </a> (&#189;) </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="stats-and-dice"> Stats and the Dice Chain </h2>


<h3 id="stats"> ATK, AIM, DEF, IQ, etc. </h3>
<p>
In most RPGs, a character has a certain set of "stats", usually in the range 3-18 by rolling 3d6 in order.  These stats then correspond to bonuses from -3 to +3.
</p><p>
In Brigandine your "stat" is a die, usually a d6, and is generated by rolling 4d2.  The stat is the die that has that many sides.  Any time the game requires rolling dice to resolve a situation, you will roll the dice corresponding to one of your stats.  The principal stats are:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt> ATK </dt><dd> Attack, representing physical ability and prowess.  Almost always the die rolled in melee combat.>/dd>
	<dt> AIM </dt><dd> Aim, representing the ability to target individuals. This includes things like good eyesight and hand-eye coordination.</dd>
	<dt> DEF </dt><dd> Defense, representing ability to avoid damage.</dd>
	<dt> IQ </dt><dd> Intelligence, representing mental ability and ease of solving technical problems. </dd>
</dl>


<h3 id="dice-chain"> The Dice Chain </h3>

<p>
When bonuses or penalties are to be applied, they should be applied to the stat to be rolled according to the dice chain:
</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
	d0-d1-d2-d3-d4-d5-d6-d7-d8-d10-d12-d14-d16-d20-d24-d30
</blockquote>
<p>
A +1 bonus means move up one step in the dice chain.  For example, if the usual die is a d6, to apply a +1 bonus, instead roll a d7.  To apply a -1 penalty to a d6, instead roll a d5.  If the usual die is a d8 and there is a +3 bonus, instead roll a d14.
</p><p>
The standard base die is the d6, which represents the ability of an average man.  Many rolls exploring the dungeon will be opposed rolls against a target die, also usually chosen to be a d6.
</p>


<h4>The weird ones</h4>
<p>
The dice d0,d1,d2,d3,d5,d7,d14,d16,d24,d30 are not as well beloved as their Platonic solid cousins.  They can nevertheless be found for sale online from dice shops or other RPG supplies.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt> d0, d1 </dt><dd> These are simply constants, either 0 or 1.  A d0 is automatic failure. </dd>
	<dt> d2 </dt><dd> Most familiarly, a coin flip.  Can also be represented using a cubical die ("d6"), by writing the numbers "1" and "2" on the faces, three times each. Even better, color one side green, the other red, and treat "green=2", "red=1".</dd>
	<dt> d3 </dt><dd> There are some specially shaped d3.  Can be more simply represented using a cubical die ("d6"), by writing numbers "1"-"3" on the faces, twice each.  Color three sides green, three red for a dual d2/d3.</dd>
	<dt> d5 </dt><dd> Specially-shaped d5s that look like triangular prisms.  Also possible by double-labeling a d10 (treat 6-10 as 1-5).</dd>
	<dt> d7 </dt><dd></dd>
	<dt> d14</dt><dd></dd>
	<dt> d16</dt><dd></dd>
	<dt> d24</dt><dd></dd>
	<dt> d30</dt><dd></dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="exploding-dice"> Exploding Dice </h4>
<p>
When rolling a d6, any natural roll of 6 is considered to "explode", and is then re-rolled.  If the result is again 6, then the result is considered a 7 and re-rolled.  If again a 6, then considered an 8 and re-rolled.  This continues until a number other than 6 is rolled.  In this way, a d6 is still able to reach a result above the usual range.
</p><p>
This applies not only to d6, but any die in the dice chain, on a maximum roll (i.e. on a natural X on a dX).
</p><p>
For instance, a result of 5 on a d5 is re-rolled, and if 5 rolled again it is considered a 6 and re-rolled, and if 5 again considered a seven, etc.
</p>


<h3 id="hits"> hits, &#35;attk, &#35;def, attk type, def type, morale </h3>
<p>
As in most other RPGs, the principal stats are the not the other numerical categorizations of a PC.  There are other factors which determine the ability of a PC, in particular in combat.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt> hits </dt><dd> A measurement of the toughness of the character, in terms of the number of times the character may survive being struck by an otherwise lethal blow.  For normal people, this is always 1.  The value is determined by class and level.</dd>
	<dt> &#35;attk </dt><dd> For a powerful warrios who fights with the strength of several men; this characterizes exactly how many men he fights with the strength of.  If 1, fight as single man; if 2, fight as 2 men; etc.  Is necessary for determining how many dice to roll on skirmish combat.  The value is determined by class and level.</dd>
	<dt> &#35;def </dt><dd> As above, but represents how well a warrior can defend himself in battle.  Is also necessary for determining how many dice to roll on skirmish combat.  The value is determined by class and level. </dd>
	<dt> type attk </dt><dd> The type of soldier that the character is classified as in melee attacks: LF, MF, HF, LC, MC, HC.  This is also necessary for determining how many dice to roll on skirmish combat.  The value is determined by class and equipped weapon.</dd>
	<dt> type def</dt><dd> The type of soldier that the character is classified as in melee defense: LF, MF, HF, LC, MC, HC.  This is also necessary for determining how many dice to roll on skirmish combat.  The value is determined by class and worn armor class.</dd>
	<dt> morale</dt><dd> The willingness and resolve of the character to fight on.  On a morale check, a character must score <b>under</b> this score on 2d6 to continue fighting.  Rarely checked for PCs.  Determined by class and level.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In any combat, it is necessary to know:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> type and &#35; attk </li>
	<li> type and &#35; def </li>
</ul>
<p>
which are all determined by
</p>
<ul>
	<li> class (type and &#35;)</li>
	<li> level (&#35;)</li>
	<li> equipment (type)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fantasy Combat Type (FC)</h3>
<p>
Some creatures are exceptionally powerful, and can only be vanquished using the Fantasy Combat rules.  Certain character classes are able to advance onto the Fantasy Combat tables, and if so are given a FC type.  This only occurs for certain classes and at higher levels.
</p>




<h2 id="point-values"> Point Values </h2>
<p>
All characters in the game have an assigned point-value.  This originates from the war game roots.  To create balanced armies in a war game, each side would be assigned a certain number of points, and each troop type a certain point value, and opponents would construct their armies within the point budgets.
</p><p>
For Brigandine, each player has a point budget of 5.
</p><p>
Players are allowed to control more than one character, provided the total value of all PCs does not exceed 5.
</p><p>
Whenever a player loses a PC, the player regains those points, which can be used at a later (reasonable) time to attempt to recruit additional characters, assuming the player's point value remains below 5. 
</p><p>
Players may also swap PCs by deliberately dropping one, thereby regaining the points, then picking up the other, expending points.  The total point value for the player must remain below 5.  PCs swapped out in this way do not continue to tag along with the party; anyone coming along must be controlled by a player.  Any PC not controlled will immediately return to civilization and remain there conducting business relevant to himself.
