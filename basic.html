<h1>Rules Overview</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
Brigandine is a low-fantasy RPG drawing on the early wargame traditions.
</p><p>
Miniature wargames are a centuries-old tradition, enacting battles on a tabletop with miniature soldier figurines deployed strategically into combat.  The hobby experienced a renaissance in the second half of the 20th century, with several gaming groups in the USA and UK developing new rules systems, tournaments, and conventions.
</p><p>
As these groups continued innovating, play began to focus more on just a few individual soldiers exploring castle ruins.  Further, with a resurgence in popularity of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> at around the same time, the traditionally strictly historical wargames began moving more towards fantasy adaptations.  The eventual result produced the world's first table-top RPG, a game of fantasy adventure and dungeon-devling.
</p><p>
Brigandine follows in many of the same footsteps, beginning with the medieval wargame rules as the starting point for game mechanics.  In many ways, it stays closer to its original wargame roots.  Every game mechanic has a precedent in medieval wargaming.  Brigandine is in some ways a reenvisioning of the historic development of RPGs, as though from an alternate universe.  At this point in the timeline, the development of a single PC per player has not quite developed; the players are controlling very small armies constructed with restricted point-buys, as in a regular wargame, and the characters the players will control are much more like the simple soldiers of a wargame table.
</p><p>
Also at this point in our alternative timeline, the fantastical elements of later RPGs have not been completely enfolded.  The assumed setting is a semi-historical late Medeival Europe during one of the many wars that tore across the continent.  The world of the PCs is mundane, even if it is full of superstition.
</p><p>
Instead of the fantastical, Brigandine uses the medieval wargame rules to emulate as nearly as possible the considerations of historical medieval combat.  In particular choices of arms, armor, and battle tactics.  It would be impractical to model every particular detail, but the goal is to draw out more of the considerations of real medieval melee combat.
</p><p>
This does not mean there is no fantastical.  Material from the fantasy supplement to the medieval wargame rules has been incorporated and will show up during play.  In the spirit of folkloric legends, the fantastical occurs only far from home, in another world beyond civilization.  It is only in realms underground, or countries no man has entered, where magic and monsters will be found.
</p>


<h2 id="char-intro"> Players and Characters</h2>
<p>
Each player controls one or many player characters (PCs).  The PCs begin as simple soldiers fighting one of the many wars that ravaged European civilization.  
</p><p>
Each player is expected to control more than one PC, but encouraged to intelligently choose the tropps they control.  As in a wargame, each soldier unit is worth some number of points, and the players have a budget for a total number of points with which to build their troops.  
</p><p>
The character classes represent soldier types.  They do not include many of the classes that have become customary in RPGs.  Below are some of the character classes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Knight</li>
	<li>Soldier</li>
	<li>Scout</li>
	<li>Peasant Levie</li>
	<li>Artillerist</li>
	<li>English Longbowman</li>
</ul>
<p>
These classes and their abilities are derived from soldier types in wargame rules.  Missing are the thief, cleric, and wizard.  Thiefs are outlaws, and a thief in a warcamp meets with justice from his fellow soldiers.  Priests should be aboveground, administering sacraments or teaching good morals; not down in stone hallways clubbing trolls.  Wizards don't exist.
</p>

<h2 id="core-mechanic"2> The Core Mechanic </h2>
<p>
As with all early RPGs, <b>there is no core mechanic</b>.  Brigandine represents a time when new rules were introduced for situations only as they arose in the course of a game, and resolutions invented by a referee.  Many of those resolution mechanics are completely different.
</p><p>
In so far as there is a core mechanic, it is that when a situation involves a possibility of failure with stakes on the ability to succeed, then a die roll is called for.  The roll may involve pools of dice, such as in skirmish combat, or only 2 dice, as in man-to-man melee.  The dice used are normally d6, but depending on the roll may be a different shape.
</p><p>
Many rolls during usual dungeon exploration will work using opposed rolls against a target dice.  All character stats (ATK, AIM, DEF, IQ) are listed as dice, and the referee will call for a roll the die corresponding to one of these stats.  The referee will then roll a target dice, usually a d6, and the player's roll must beat the target dice result.  In opposed rolls, the smallest die must always be rolled first.
</p>

<h2 id="dice-chain"> The Dice Chain </h2>
<p>
When bonuses or penalties are to be applied, they should be applied to the stat to be rolled according to the dice chain:
</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
	d0-d1-d2-d3-d4-d5-d6-d7-d8-d10-d12-d14-d16-d20-d24-d30
</blockquote>
<p>
A +1 bonus means move up one step in the dice chain.  For example, if the usual die is a d6, to apply a +1 bonus, instead roll a d7.  To apply a -1 penalty to a d6, instead roll a d5.  If the usual die is a d8 and there is a +3 bonus, instead roll a d14.
</p><p>
The standard base die is the d6, which represents the ability of an average man.  Many rolls exploring the dungeon will be opposed rolls against a target die, also usually chosen to be a d6.
</p>


<h3 id="weird-dice">The weird ones</h3>
<p>
The dice d0,d1,d2,d3,d5,d7,d14,d16,d24,d30 are not as well beloved as their Platonic solid cousins.  They can nevertheless be found for sale online from dice shops or other RPG suppliers.  Below are osme notes on these.
</p>
<dl>
	<dt> d0, d1 </dt><dd> These are simply constants, either 0 or 1.  A d0 means automatic failure. </dd>
	<dt> d2 </dt><dd> Most familiarly, a coin flip.  Can also be represented using a cubical die ("d6"), by writing the numbers "1" and "2" on the faces, three times each. Even better, color one side green, the other red, and treat "green=2", "red=1".</dd>
	<dt> d3 </dt><dd> There are some specially shaped d3.  Can be more simply represented using a cubical die ("d6"), by writing numbers "1"-"3" on the faces, twice each.  Color three sides green, three red for a dual d2/d3.</dd>
	<dt> d5 </dt><dd> Specially-shaped d5s look like triangular prisms.  Also possible by double-labeling a d10 (treat 6-10 as 1-5).</dd>
	<dt> d7 </dt><dd>This one is a true beauty to behold.  Can also be replicated by double-labeling a d14 (treat 8-14 as 1-7).</dd>
	<dt> d14</dt><dd>Appears very spherical.  The only roll that can not be replicated with other dice.</dd>
	<dt> d16</dt><dd>Also very spherical, easy to confuse with the d14 on sight.  For math or computer nerds, can be replicated using four dice labeled 0,1 and reading the result in binary.</dd>
	<dt> d24</dt><dd>This is in effect a d6 with rectangular prisms glued to each face.  Can be replicated using a a d6 and a d4.  Based on the d4: (1) treat d6 result as 1-6, (2) treat d6 result as 7-12, (3) treat d6 result as 13-18, (4) treat d6 result as 19-24.</dd>
	<dt> d30</dt><dd>Can be replicated using a d3 and a d10, similar to rolling d%.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="exploding-dice"> Exploding dice </h3>
<p>
When rolling a d6, any natural roll of 6 is considered to "explode", and is then re-rolled.  If the result is again 6, then the result is considered a 7 and re-rolled.  If again a 6, then considered an 8 and re-rolled.  This continues until a number other than 6 is rolled.  In this way, a d6 is still able to reach a result above the usual range.
</p><p>
This applies not only to d6, but any die in the dice chain, on a maximum roll (i.e. on a natural X on a dX).
</p><p>
For instance, a result of 5 on a d5 is re-rolled, and if 5 rolled again it is considered a 6 and re-rolled, and if 5 again considered a 7, etc.
</p>

<h2 id="use-minis"> Use of Miniatures </h2>
<p>
Brigandine is based on rules for wargames originally played with miniature figurines.  These figurines would be placed on elaborate battle maps featuring replica trees, buildings, streams, hills.
</p><p>
This level of detail is not needed to play Brigandine, though certainly invited.
</p><p>
However, because players will be controlling multiple PCs, and because things like marching order and formations are very important, mentally keeping track of the location of each PC can become too much.  It is therefore supremely useful to employ some sort of battle map, and represent PCs on this map.  This map could be the original sand tables with painted tin minis, it could be a sheet of paper with different colored beads representing characters, or it could be a white board with "X"s scribbled where PCs are standing.  It should show relatively how far apart things are, and where PCs are located.
</p><p>
Miniatures are a play aid only.  Miniatures and battle mats are not strictly needed.  It is not necessary to intricately track distances with rulers or grids, or keep track of areas of effect in terms of grid spacings.  Distances on the battle map should be roughly proportional, but are otherwise whatever the referee says they are.
</p><p>
It is the responsibility of each player to move his PCs.  Wherever the PC's mini (loosely interpretted) has been placed, is where the PC will be assumed to be, for weal or for woe.
</p>

<h2 id="encumbrance"> Encumbrance </h2>
<p>
Exactly what gear a soldier has equipped, where it is equipped, and how quickly he could reach it, were crucial to success on the battlefield.  A dagger in your backpack does no good when you drop your sword in a melee.  Supply limitations were often decisive in warfare.
</p><p>
To capture this, Brigandine recommends a slot-based system of encumbrance that is carefully tracked.
</p><p>
All gear is in one of three categories: Equipped, At-Hand, and Packed.  What can be put where is limited by a number of slots in each, where each slot can hold at most 1 item.  Some larger items require more than 1 slot.
</p><p>
This will be revisted in <a href="items.html#encumbrance">Items and Equipment</a>.
</p><p>
Weight is not tracked in Brigandine.  If an item is especially heavy, this should be represented by occupying multiple inventory slots, even if the item itself is physically small.
