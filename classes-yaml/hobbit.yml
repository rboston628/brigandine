description: >

class_features: 
  - feature: Luck o' the wee-folk
    description: >
      All hobbits have an additional stat, LUCK, rolled 4d2 as the 
      others. The hobbit may re-roll any natural 1 on any roll, using 
      the LUCK die instead. Use of this ability requires keeping his 
      luck up, which means adhering to superstitions.
  - feature: Thrown stone
    description: >
      Hobbits are most effective at throwing stones (by hand or with 
      a sling), and so with these weapons count as additional 
      #firing, as above (stone).
  - feature: Tricksy
    description: >
      Hobbits are small, and oft-overlooked. They are easily able to 
      hide from danger, or to sneak up on big-folk. While sneaking, 
      they may attempt to pick pockets, or to backstab. 
      To sneak requires an opposed LUCK roll against target's IQ.
  - feature: Pony riding
    description: >
      Hobbits can only sit ahorse on ponies or smaller. 
      They may be carried on a horse, but cannot effectively attack 
      this way.
  - feature: Encumbrance
    description: >
      Hobbits cannot carry as much as the big-folk, so have a reduced 
      inventory. They must also use some weapons two-handed (rank 5+) 
      which would otherwise be one-handed. Weapons which big-folk need 
      two hands for (8+) cannot be used at all. 
      Armor which is crafted for taller races will not fit a hobbit.
  - feature: Fantasy Combat
    description: >
      Despite their loyal hearts, hobbits are no great warriors, nor 
      remembered for their deeds in battle. 
      Hobbits have no natural FC, though may use magic swords.
