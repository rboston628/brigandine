    description: >
      A priest is able to say blessings. This is limited by his number of daily blessings. See below.
  - feature: Exorcism

      A priest may use his prayers and crucifix to attack certain creatues in Fantasy Combat 
      as though armed with a magic sword:
      <ul>
        <li>lycanthropes (needs 9)</li>
        <li>demons (needs 12)</li>
        <li>wights (needs 6)</li>
        <li>wraiths (needs 8)</li>
      </ul>
      Against non-FC undead monsters, the priest rolls 2d6 on the skill check table, 
      using his level as the number of own figures, and can kill that many creatures. 
      Certain holy relics may grant more own figures. The priest requires the formulae written 
      in his prayerbook for this action.
  - feature: Set apart
    description: >
      A priest may not wield any weapon except the weapons of the spirit: a crucifix, 
      his prayerbook, and the sacraments. If he chooses to use a weapon in combat, he attacks as a peasant. 
      He loses all daily blessings. Afterward he must spend an hour in repentance.
  - feature: Oratio vulgaris
    description: >
      Priests can read and speak fluent Latin. This can facilitate easier communication with foreigners.
  - feature: Liturgia horarum
    description: >
      Each night, the priest must sing evensong. If the priest misses these prayers, 
      he may use no blessings the next day. 
      The other soldiers on the adventure are expected to join the priest in prayer. 
      Repeated refusal by soldiers may cause blessings to fail. 
      The words of evensong are engraved on the priest's heart; they may be recalled without the prayerbook.

  <h2>Blessings</h2>
  <p>
  A priest is able to say any of the below blessings, subject to his daily limit.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Eucharist</dt>
    <dd>
      The priest can consecrate holy eucharist.  When administered to the soldiers, 
      it removes any curse or negative spiritual effects.  When touched to certain wicked abominations, 
      it can attack FC-only monsters as though in Fantasy Combat (see Exorcism).  
      This must be stored in a pyx box.  If mishandled, the priest loses this abiity.
    </dd>
    <dt>Chrismation</dt>
    <dd>
      The priest may annoint another character before combat.  During the next combat, this soldier 
      will require simulataneous hits equal to his &#35;def to take any damage.
    </dd>
    <dt>Extreme Unction</dt>
    <dd>
      The priest may touch one friendly character to restore one hit to that character's &#35;def.  
      This may be done to revive a character dead less than one exploration turn, unless that 
      character's body was destroyed (suffered more hits than &#35;def).
    </dd>
    <dt>Visions</dt>
    <dd>
      The priest will retreat into prayerful meditation to seek an answer to a question.  
      For each hour spent in prayer, he rolls as that many number own figures on the skill check table.  
      Depending on how high the result, he receives a spiritual answer.
    </dd>
    <dt>Consecrate</dt>
    <dd>
      The priest creates a ring of protection.  Evil creatures will not enter this ring.  
      The ring remains until the priest leaves its bounds, at which point the power dissipates.
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h2> Adapting to Other Deities </h2>
  <p>
  Because the setting is assumed to be Continental Europe in the Middle Ages, 
  the priest is assumed to be Christian (either Roman or Byzantine, 
  or by stretching the time period Celtic/Anglican or Lutheran).  
  If it makes sense within the context of the adventure, the priest may alternately be 
  an Islamic imam, a Jewish rabbi, or even a Zoroastrian magus, mutatis mutandis.
  </p><p>
  If the priest joins the party from a fantasy otherworld, this may be any other religion appropriate 
  to that world.
  </p><p>
  This class is written with monotheism in mind.  The priests of heathen gods are more warlike, 
  but their deities are also self-interested and amoral.  Their blessings will be only minor kick-backs 
  in thanks for larger sacrifices.  It is recommended heathen priests be handled more like wizards or elves.
