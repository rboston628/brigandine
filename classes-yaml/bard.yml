class_features:
  - feature: Lore
    description: >
      The bard is fluent in Latin, French, and the language of his 
      native country (if his native country is France, he is fluent 
      in either Italian or Icelandic).  He knows many legends now 
      only dimly remembered, and can recount ballads of epic heroes 
      from past times or peoples.  If attempting to use the bard's 
      lore for information on a quest, make a skill check, and the 
      higher the roll the more information is gleaned.
  - feature: Inspiration
    description: >
      If the bard sings of warrior saints or ancient heroes of old, 
      he can inspire those near him in battle.  One friendly unit 
      hearing this song rolls attacks one-higher in the dice chain.  
      Multiple bards singing will cancel each other out for no effect.
  - feature: Performance
    description: >
      The bard is a skilled performer, instantly welcome in any 
      tavern or pub, provided he sing or recite. The bard can easily 
      gain money by plying his profession.
  - feature: Playing Hands
    description: >
      A bard needs his hands for playing his instrument, and without 
      them cannot perform his art.  He is entirely unsuited to any 
      kind of combat, prefering to hang in the back and hope the 
      others take care of it.  When forced into combat, he fights as 
      an unarmed peasant.
  - feature: Vanity
    description: >
      As bards tend to be naturally vain, it is not possible to have 
      more than one bard in an adventuring party.
