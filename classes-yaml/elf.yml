  Also called fairies, the fair-folk, or in some lands the sidhe.
  </p><p>
  Fairies are arrogant and cruel, viewing their immortal lives and 
  their own power as far more important than any mortal concern.  
  The lives of humans pass each season like clockwork, and yet the 
  fairies live on.  Most fairies lack a human's conscience, 
  showing no remorse for using mortals as pawns in their own schemes.
  </p><p>
  Whatever your mortal companions may hope to accomplish in this 
  quest, your motives are your own, and extend to matters far more 
  cosmically meaningful than the may-flys could even comprehend with 
  their tiny, small minds.  You are willing to accompany them, 
  because your paths are temporarily aligned.
  </p><p>
  If you choose to play as an elf, you must play <i>as</i> an elf.  
  Your motivatons and psyche are not those of a human.

class_features:
  - feature: Eldar time
    description: >
      You are hundreds, perhaps thousands of years old. 
      You remember this country before any mortal man dared cross 
      into it, and when those who did were little better than beasts 
      swinging sticks. This entire campaign will be as though a 
      single passing day in your elven life. 
      As such, fairies progress more slowly and do not progress in 
      rank beyond 2nd, as it would take several hundred more years 
      to reach rank 3.
  - feature: Iron aversion
    description: >
      Fairies cannot abide the touch of iron.  Normal steel takes 
      half-again as many kills against a fairy (i.e. 1.5x), and more 
      primitive iron double kills (2x).  Fairies cannot handle steel 
      nor iron weapons, nor wear armor made of the same.  
      They will often prefer alloys of bronze.  
      Wealthy fairies will opt for mithril.
  - feature: The god whose name they may not speak
    description: >
      Fairies are quite friendly with the heathen gods, and may have 
      even met some of them.  However, they are repulsed by any sign 
      of Christianity.  This is a physical reaction, not prejudice.  
      They may not handle normal European cruciform swords; the only 
      swords they may use are curved scimitars or falchions.  
      They will not touch any sort of crucifix, sacramental, nor holy 
      relic, and they will flinch if a mortal says any holy name.  
      They will not listen to a priest's prayers, and so are immune 
      to any positive effects of a clerical blessing.
  - feature: Magic
    description: >
      Elves are not unversed in magic, and not bound to the same rules 
      as mortals. An elf knows a set number of spells, and 4 daily 
      spell pips to cast them with. He does not require a 
      spellbook to remember these, and his use of magic is not 
      limited by arms or armor.
  - feature: Ultravision
    description: >
      Fairies possess ultravision, being able to see colors that mortals cannot. 
      During daytime and aboveground this may provide clues, and during nighttime and 
      aboveground they may see as though it were twilight. Magic artifacts, including 
      magic swords, are a bright source of ulraviolet light that dim out any natural source, 
      so ultravision will not work in the presence of such objects.
  - feature: Fantasy Combat
    description: >
      At level 2, Elves may fight in Fantasy Combat as Hero types.
