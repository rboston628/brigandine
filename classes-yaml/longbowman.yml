class_features: 
  - feature: English longbow
    description: >
      English longbows have exceptionally heavy draw weights, requiring conditioning 
      through repeated practice. The longbowman is the only class who has this practice. 
      The longbowman may use the English longbow with either ATK or AIM dice. 
      If resting overnight in a wooded area, the longbowman will replenish his own arrows.
  - feature: Defensive stakes
    description: >
      If a longbowman has been unmoved for 2 turns on soft ground, and has the defensive stakes, 
      then the longbowman will have placed the stakes around his position. 
      This grants additional defenses against cavalry and frontal attacks.
  - feature: Arm moveent
    description: >
      Archery requires free arm movement. For armor, longbowmen can only equip gambeson, leather or brigandine.
  - feature: Fantasy Combat
    description: >
      At 5th level, the Enlish longbowman can attack FC-only creatures with his normal archery, 
      treating his arrow as though an enchanted arrow on the Fantasy Combat table.
