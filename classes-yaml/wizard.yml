class_features:
  - feature: Magic
    description: >
      A mage is able to cast terrible spells.  
      The wizard begins knowing three spells, and there is no limit to the number 
      of spells he may learn over the course of the adventure.  All known spells 
      must be recorded in the grimoire, which the wizard must consult each night 
      in order to cast spells the next day.  
      Loss of the grimoire means the loss of all known spells.
  - feature: Spell Die
    description: >
      The wizard's magical power is represented by his spell die.  The wizard first 
      declares the spell he wishes to cast, then rolls the die. 
      The spell succeeds if the die shows sufficient pips for the spell.  
      On a natural 1, the spell die drops -1d in the dice chain, even if the spell 
      succeeds.  
      Even if the spell is disrupted before the roll, the wizard <b>must</b>
      roll the spell die after the casting has been declared.  
      The spell die resets after a full night's rest and an hour 
      spent in quiet study.
  - feature: Inner strength
    description: >
      Wizards are masters of arcane knowledge, who have spent long lives in 
      perplexing study.  As such they are weak, feeble, and often quite elderly. 
      They are considered untrained in all arms and armor, and quite useless 
      at any physical exertion.
  - feature: Weapon restrictions
    description: >
      The arcane forces of magic interact unpredictably with metal on the 
      wizard's person.  
      A wizard may not cast spells if holding a weapon, nor while wearing armor.  
      Even armor such as leather or gambeson tends to insulate and constrain the 
      release of power, causing spell failure.  As such, a wizard may wear only 
      loose cloth robes while casting spells.
  - feature: Fantasy Combat
    description: >
      Beginning at 4th rank, a Wizard can attack on the Fantasy Combat tables 
      as a Wizard.
