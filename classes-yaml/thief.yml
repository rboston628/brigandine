      The thief is here to do a job.  The rest of the work, that's on you.  He will open the doors and chests, 
      and keep an eye out for traps.  That's his job.  Your job is to make sure he gets to do his job.  
      The thief will not engage in combat except as a last resort.  If he suspects a combat is too dangerous, 
      or that the others in his party might fail to neutralize a threat, or that the whole gang will be caught, 
      he will silently slip away to safety, carrying off whatever loot he can.
