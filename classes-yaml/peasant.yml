    description: >
      Peasants only act as a unit. 
      They always attack with the skirmish combat rules, even if all other player forces 
      are engaged in man-to-man melee, and even if there is only a single peasant in the levie. 
      All peasants controlled by a player must form up within at most three separate units. 
      All peasants in one unit have the same core stats. 
      If there is ambiguity about unit core stats, use

    description: >
      Each unit of peasants in the player's control must pass a morale check at the beginning 
      of each round of combat. If failed, that unit does not act that round. 
      If attacked, the unit will fall back or flee.
