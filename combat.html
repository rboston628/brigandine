<h1>Combat</h1>

<p>
In Brigandine, there is not merely one kind of combat, but four.  They are as follows:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt><a href="#skirmish">Skirmish</a></dt><dd>Used for quick resolutions, or for combat against weaker, unimportant foes.</dd>
	<dt><a href="#man-to-man">Man-to-Man</a></dt><dd>Used to simulate in detail acts of swordplay and combat.</dd>
	<dt><a href="#joust">Jousting</a></dt><dd>A specialized system for choosing placement of strikes for single-combat duels</dd>
	<dt><a href="#fantasy-combat">Fantasy Combat</a></dt><dd>For use against foes which can otherwise not be slain by mortal men</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Any of these four may appear in the course of an adventure.
</p><p>
In general, all combat involves determining the attack and defensive strengths of each side (e.g. attk 2HF, def 1LC), determining the number of strikes each side may make, rolling the requisite dice (almost always ATK with melee and AIM with missile fire), then resolving successful strikes to determine victory.
</p><p>
Each system is explained below.
</p>

<h2 id="skirmish">Skirmish Combat</h2>
<p>
This is the default combat system of the game, and serves as a baseline for all other combat.  Skirmish combat derives from wargame rules for units of several figures fighting.  Here each unit is a single figure, but that single figure may have the fighting strength of multiple men.  The resolution is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> Determine the attacker's type and strength:	
		<ul>
			<li> attk type --- whether LF,MF,HF,LC,MC,HC </li>
			<li> &#35;attk --- representing the effective number of men fighting</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li> Determine the defender's type and strength:
		<ul>
			<li> def type --- whether LF,MF,HF,LC,MC,HC </li>
			<li> &#35;def --- representing the effective number of men defending </li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li> Find cell in table corresponding to attacker/defender types.  This cell lists the number of dice per man
</ol>

<p>
This matrix isn't the one we want to use (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ox4sCJnCpzo">flails are absolutely not God's gift to fighters</a>), but we want to use a matrix <b>like</b> this.
</p><p>
Using a matrix allows us to express any kind of relation between armor and weapon and level --- not merely simple linear equations, but quadratic, exponential, sinusoidal, whatever.  Rather than smoothing and simplifying the table, let's  build off the philosophy of it, and accept unpredictable relations between to-hit odds, armor, and weapon class.
</p><p>
In D&D, the characters gain experience.  We expect more experienced fighters to be more effective at hitting.  So the simple matrix of Chainmail might work well for the level 1 soldiers it originally represented, but needs to expand beyond this.
</p>
<div>
The level 2 matrix will have different numbers, but is otherwise similar.  Now imagine stacking level 2 on top of level 1, then level 3 on top of level 2, etc.  We end up forming a 3D cube of numbers.  
<img src='tensor.png' width='1000'>
</br>
Then different slices of the cube would give:
<ul>
	<li> for a given level, target roll for each weapon to hit against each armor </li>
	<li> for a given weapon, target roll for each level to hit each armor </li>
	<li> for a given armor, target roll needed for each weapon at each level to hit it </li>
</ul>
I think the first two are the most useful.  The player character sheet can retain a matrix of weapon class vs armor class for the PC's current level.  Whenever the PC gains a level, update the matrix.  In addition, unique or magical weapons can be printed onto index cards, listing the name, properties, and also including the level vs. armor matrix for this particular weapon.
</div>

<p>
Scaling in attack effectiveness seems like a fighter thing.  I don't know why a wizard, cleric, or thief should get better at fighting.  Let's say only fighting men and dwarves (maybe hobbits) get new attack matrices.  It is a class feature specific to fighters.
</p><p>
In principle, fighting men and dwarves could even have their own attack matrices, so that e.g.. dwarves are more effective with hammers and less effective with daggers.  But this is becoming overkill.  We will use the same attack matrices for humans and demihumans.
</p>

<h3>Matrices remove crunch</h3>
<p>
THAC0 is crunch.  Matrices remove crunch. The anti-THAC0 core mechanic is: roll 2d6, look on the table, compare to the table.  You do not need to track STR and level bonuses, DEX bonuses, damage type vulnerabilities, or any of that.  You roll, you look.
</p><p>
The only mental effort involved is looking for the row/cell intersection.  Is this really more mental effort then addition/subtraction and bonus tracking?
</p>

<h3>Matrices can express varying weapon difficulty</h3>
<p>
Fighters won't necessarily progress with all weapons uniformly with level.  For instance, a pitchfork isn't the sort of weapon one improves with much.  You stick 'em with the pointy end, and that's about it.  A peasant can use them about as well as a knight.  That doesn't mean pitchforks are particularly great in the hands of peasants or knights.  
</p>
<div>
The weapon matrix for a <b>pitchfork</b> might look like this:
<table style="text-align: center; padding: 15px;">
<tbody>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>AC</th>
		<th>unarmored</th>
		<th>leather</th>
		<th>shield only</th>
		<th>leahter+shield</th>
		<th>mail</th>
		<th>mail+shield</th>
		<th>plate</th>
		<th>plate+shield</th>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 1-3</th>
		<td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>13</td><td>13</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>level 4-5</th>
		<td>7</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 6-7</th>
		<td>7</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>5</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>level 8-9</th>
		<td>6</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>11</td><td>12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 10</th>
		<td>6</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>10</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The logic of the table:
<ul>
	<li> very high levels might get better at jabbing than others, but overall progression is slow </li>
	<li> defeating a guy with only a shield does sound like something a more experienced fighter would be able to handle better </li>
	<li> mail has tiny gaps, and piercing weapons can often penetrate these gaps, so mail is susceptible to a pitchfork </li>
	<li> mail and shield can't be worse than just shield by itself </li>
	<li> plate is impervious to a pitchfork, unless you are skilled enough to hit exactly right </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
We could compare this to a weapon like a two-handed sword, which in the hands of a peasant is little better than a sharpened stick, but in the hands of a knight is a powerful weapon.  The weapon matrix for a <b>two-handed sword</b> might look like this:
<table style="text-align: center; padding: 15px;">
<tbody>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>AC</th>
		<th>unarmored</th>
		<th>leather</th>
		<th>shield only</th>
		<th>leahter+shield</th>
		<th>mail</th>
		<th>mail+shield</th>
		<th>plate</th>
		<th>plate+shield</th>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 1-3</th>
		<td>5</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>13</td><td>13</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>level 4-5</th>
		<td>4</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 6-7</th>
		<td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>12</td><td>12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>level 8-9</th>
		<td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>10</td><td>12</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 10</th>
		<td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>10</td><td>10</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The logic is as follows:
<ul>
	<li> anyone swinging a sword at an unarmored man is probably going to kill him </li>
	<li> at extreme levels, cutting flesh and cutting animal hide are basically the same, and are very easy </li>
	<li> mail is effective at blocking slashes, but experienced swordsmen can learn to exploit weaknesses </li>
	<li> shields are no match for an experienced swordsman </li>
	<li> plate is essentially impervious to swords, except to the very skilled </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
This shows how matrices could be used to give non-linear, non-uniform level progression stats for different weapons.
</p>


<h3> Matrices can express weapon specialties </h3>

<div>
I've been treating plate as somehow impossible to hit, but now consider a weapon like a <b>warhammer</b>, which is specifically meant to damage plate:
<table style="text-align: center; padding: 15px;">
<tbody>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>AC</th>
		<th>unarmored</th>
		<th>leather</th>
		<th>shield only</th>
		<th>leahter+shield</th>
		<th>mail</th>
		<th>mail+shield</th>
		<th>plate</th>
		<th>plate+shield</th>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 1-3</th>
		<td>8</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>8</td><td>10</td><td>9</td><td>11</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>level 4-5</th>
		<td>7</td><td>7</td><td>9</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>9</td><td>8</td><td>10</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 6-7</th>
		<td>6</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>8</td><td>6</td><td>8</td><td>7</td><td>9</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>level 8-9</th>
		<td>5</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>5</td><td>7</td><td>6</td><td>8</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 10</th>
		<td>4</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>6</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>6</td><td>7</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The logic here:
<ul>
	<li> a warhammer is meant to pierce armor, and views hide or plate or mail as equally piercible </li>
	<li> a warhammer is not meant to pierce a shield, so shields are effective defenses </li>
	<li> plate is more difficult to pierce than mail </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div>
To go completely crazy, consider a magic sword, which cuts through all materials and can only be stopped by catching it on a shield first:
<table style="text-align: center; padding: 15px;">
<tbody>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>AC</th>
		<th>unarmored</th>
		<th>leather</th>
		<th>shield only</th>
		<th>leahter+shield</th>
		<th>mail</th>
		<th>mail+shield</th>
		<th>plate</th>
		<th>plate+shield</th>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 1-3</th>
		<td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>level 4-5</th>
		<td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 6-7</th>
		<td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="white">
		<th>level 8-9</th>
		<td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td>
	</tr>
	<tr bgcolor="#DCDCDC">
		<th>level 10</th>
		<td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>5</td>
	</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
The logic here:
<ul>
	<li> anyone swinging this swings it just as well, with or without skill </li>
	<li> armor is irrelevant </li>
	<li> only a shield can catch it, and even then odds are high the shield is negated anyway </li>
</ul>
(I do not recommend giving this sword to any characters in a game.)
</div>

<h3>Matrices create strategy</h3>
<p>
In D&D, there is very little difference between a maul and a battle axe.  Attack bonuses are the same, damage die are the same, damage bonuses are the same.  The maul might do double damage against a stone golem and the axe double damage against a flesh golem, but overall the difference is so rare that it is not worth lugging both a maul and an axe around everywhere.
</p><p>
Real medieval combatants carried several arms.  A pole arm for charges, a sword for up-close battle, a warhammer for damaging armored foes, a dagger for grappling.  They carried these because some weapons were efficient, others weren't, depending on how the enemy was armed.  
</p><p>
Real medieval combatants took time to strap many peices of weighty metal plating all over their body.  Metal gloves, metal greaves, metal shoes, metal skirting, metal breastplates, metal arm covers, all of which needed to be strapped in place by someone assisting.  They did this because, covered in armored plating, they became nearly impervious to all but specialized weapons or incredibly well-aimed blows.
</p><p>
Matrices, which can easily capture the different effectiveness of weapons, helps recapture this notion of strategic choice of arms.
</p>


<h2>The downsides of matrices, and solutions</h2>
<p>
Attack matrices have downsides.  Obviously, or we'd never have left them.
</p>

<h3>Matrices can't exist in your head</h3>
<p>
The simple linear equations of the Core Mechanic can be computed on the fly in your head in almost no time, requiring memorizing only a single number (your total bonus with this weapon).  Tables require space (either physical space, or monitor and hard drive space), they require look-up (looking up the table and then looking up the correct cell), and they can't be predicted.  Even the single, simple table of OD&D was pushed down the path of THAC0 to make gameplay faster and simpler.
</p><p>
The matrices could be memorized, but that's unrealistic.
</p><p>
Only one row of the matrix is needed at a time, the one corresponding to the PC's current level.  
To avoid the mental energy of lookup, the needed row of the attack matrix should be printed on a character sheet or other clearly visible, central location.
</p>

<h3>Proliferation of matrices</h3>
<p>
Proposing a distinct to-hit matrix for every weapon, with varying level progression and varying damage per armor class quickly leads to too many tables.  It is also a burnout for DMs, who have more work to do just to give out a new weapon or suit of armor.
</p>
<div>
Special to-hit matrices then should be for special weapons.  For all normal, mundane weapons, have a single matrix.  Below is my version, adapted form Chainmail but with some variation:
<table style="text-align: center; padding: 15px;">

</table>
On this table, fighters add a simple level bonus to their roll.  A little bonus goes a long way on 2d6, so I recommend being sparing with any bonus.  Perhaps fighters should roll:
<ul>
	<li> 2d6</li>
	<li> d6+d7</li>
	<li> 2d7</li>
	<li> d7+d8</li>
	<li>2d8</li>
</ul>
increasing with level.
</div>
<p>
All classes except Fighter (and possibly Dwarf) roll on this matrix with no bonus.  On weapon-specific tables, they either roll on the level 1 column, or possibly even just roll on the standard table for the same weapon type.
</p><p>
Rather than mace and morning star categories, they are club and mace.  A club is any purely blunt bluedgeoning instrument, while a mace is any blunt weapon with spikes or flanges affixed, intended for piercing or destroying armor.  This category includes morning stars.  Flails have been removed; medieval flails, if they existed, were mostly bludgeoning implements, as clubs; but if you want spikes on yours, use the mace row.  The category of pole arms includes halberds, along with war scythes, billhooks, etc.  Separate categories are listed for spears, pikes, and poleaxes, due to their importance in different aspects of medieval warfare.  A battle axe is a Dane axe, bearded axe, or other such implement requiring two hands but with a haft shorter than a poleaxe.
</p><p>
Pikes are really intended to battle against cavalry, and the mounted figure columns aren't shown here.  This is perhaps an oversight on my part, as it is certainly reasonable to consider certian classes of monsters (and not only centaurs) as roughly equivalent to fighting an armored man on horseback.  For instance, Chainmail counted a Balrog as two heavy horse.  You would imagine pikes would serve a similar usefulness against such monsters.
</p><p>
You will notice that plate is incredibly hard to strike.  That's because it is.  They wore it for a reason.  This should be taken into account in armor prices and availability.  Plate requires specific tailoring to an individual, which should be extremely expensive, requirng a professional armorer and apprentices working for several weeks.  Even if found in a dungeon, it needs to be fit by an armorer, or else it counts as mail.
</p><p>
A future addition might be a distinction between <i>suits of plate</i>, and mere <i>plate</i> pieces as armor, such as only a breastplate.  It is really only a suit of plate that deserves such impossible odds of damage.
</p><p>
Not represented by these tables are considerations such as weapon range and differing weapon damage dice.  A weapon might have a harder time striking, but make up for it by carrying a larger damage die.
</p><p>
These are the anti-THAC0 attack matrices.  Instead of simplifying mechanics, they deliberate invoke more complexity through tables.  They do not require mental math, but do require table lookups.  They allow for strategic weapon and armor choice, and give fighters an additional combat advantage over other classes.   Not only do fighters have more choices for strategy, they also become more proficient, using new tables, as they increase in level.
</p>
