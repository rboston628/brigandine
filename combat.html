<h1>Combat</h1>

<p>
In Brigandine, there is not merely one kind of combat, but four.  They are as follows:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt><a href="#skirmish">Skirmish</a></dt><dd>Used for quick resolutions, or for combat against weaker, unimportant foes.</dd>
	<dt><a href="#man-to-man">Man-to-Man</a></dt><dd>Used to simulate in detail acts of swordplay and combat.</dd>
	<dt><a href="#joust">Jousting</a></dt><dd>A specialized system for choosing placement of strikes for single-combat duels.</dd>
	<dt><a href="#fantasy-combat">Fantasy Combat</a></dt><dd>For use against foes which can otherwise not be slain by mortal men.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Any of these four may appear in the course of an adventure.
</p><p>
In general, all combat involves:
<ul>
	<li> determining the attack and defensive strengths of each side (e.g. attk 2HF, def 1LC),</li>
	<li> determining the number of strikes each side may make, </li>
	<li> rolling the requisite dice (almost always ATK with melee and AIM with missile fire),</li>
	<li> then resolving successful strikes to determine victory.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Each system is explained below.
</p>

<h2 id="combat-order">Combat Order</h2>
<p>
Whenever it is determined that combat should occur, all players will roll <b>IQ</b> to determine the order of initiative.   Each player rolls, not each character.  The referee may split up or combine the enemy forces in initiative however makes sense.  Higher results move first in intiative.  A tie means the characters act simultaneously in initiative.
</p><p>
Combat occurs in rounds, broken up into these phases:
</p>
<dl>
	<dt> 1. reactions </dt><dd> All players roll <b>IQ</b> for initiative.  Any player may elect to delay initiative, resorting to a "1" on the roll.  Resolve any reaction rolls (surprise, morale, etc.). </dd>
	<dt> 2. declare actions </dt><dd> All players declare what they will do over the round: firing missiles, moving, melee, etc.  Artillery fire must be declared now, and cannot be changed.  Any communication between PCs occurs here.</dd>
	<dt> 3. first movement </dt><dd> All players move up to half movement (or charge), in initiative order. Side arms may be drawn.</dd>
	<dt> 4. first missiles </dt><dd> All missile fire taken in initiative order. </dd>
	<dt> 5. melee </dt><dd> All hand-to-hand melees are resolved according to the combat system. </dd>
	<dt> 6. artillery </dt> <dd> All previously declared artillery fire now occurs. An arquibusier who has not fired or moved may reload.</dd>
	<dt> 7. second movement </dt><dd> Any player who did not melee may now move up to half movement, in initiative order.  </dd>
	<dt> 8. second missiles </dt><dd> Any archer who only engaged in missile fire (no movement or melee) may fire a second time, in initiative order.  Crossbowmen who only moved up to half movement and/or fired (no melee) may reload.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
These phases repeat over the next round, until combat is finished.
</p><p>
Note that all combatants resolve the first phase, then all combatants resolve the second phase, and so on.  Iniative may be re-rolled at the start of each turn, or optionally kept the same throughout the battle.
</p>
<h3>Clarifications on combat order</h3>
<p>
Any combatant engaging in melee (even if only defending) may not take any further actions this round.
</p><p>
Side arms are drawn on the first movement phase, not during melee.  Players should think carefully about which arm they should have equipped when the melee phase arrives.
</p><p>
The second firing phase is only for archers specifically, including longbowmen, who have only fired once.  This does not include crossbows, or any other shooters with a weapon other than a bow.  This means archers may fire at best twice/round, provided they do not do anything else.
</p><p>
Crossbowmen and arquibusiers may fire on the first combat round.  After the first combat round, a crossbow or arquibus may only be fired if it was reloaded in the previous round.
</p><p>
Crossbowmen may only move on <i>one</i> of the movement phases to be able to reload in the second missile phase.  They may only fire their crossbows in the first missile phase.  This means crossbowmen may fire at best once/round, provided they do not move more than half movement and are not meleed.
</p><p>
Artillery (including arquibusiers) may not act between declaring fire and the artillery phase.  They must be focused on handling the artillery and carefully aiming during all intervening phases.  If they do anything else, including being meleed (but not fired upon), they lose the shot.
</p><p>
Arquibusiers may not fire and reload in the same round.  They may only move on the second movement phase to be able to reload.  This means arquibusiers may fire at best once/two rounds, provided they are not meleed and do not move too much.
</p>

<h3>Charges</h3>
<p>
On the first movement phase, units may charge, provided the right conditions are met:
</p>
<ul>
	<li> the charging unit may move <b>up to</b> its full movement </li>
	<li> the charging unit <b>must</b> come into contact with enemy forces during the charge</li>
	<li> the charge <b>must</b> be in a straight line </li>
	<li> the charging unit <b>must</b> immediately engage in melee combat</li>
</ul>
<p>
The resulting melee is immediately resolved during the first movement phase.  If the charging unit is victorious, the unit <b>must</b> continue moving in the same direction for the rest of its full movement.  If more enemy forces are encountered, melee must be immediately resolved again, until the charging unit is detained or exhausts its full movement.
</p><p>
The charging unit <b>may not</b> act further this round.  If meleed further, they may not defend.  On the following round, they may only move.
</p><p>
Infantry facing a cavalry charge must pass a morale check to stand.
</p>

<h3>Morale</h3>
<p>
Certain situations may call for checking morale.  The procedure is to roll 2d6; on a result equal to or higher than the character's morale score, the check has passed.  On a failure, the characters will refuse to engage in combat, will flee, will surrender, or otherwise fail in battle.
</p>

<h3>Surprise</h3>
<p>
Certain situations may call for checking for surprise.  This usually occurs at the beginning of a combat, but could occur whenever someone sneaks upon the combatants.
</p><p>
To check surprise... 
</p><p>
If the surprise succeeds, a surprise round is played.  In a surprise round, only the surprising party may act until the end of the melee phase.  After the melee phase, all parties may act.
</p><p>

<h2 id="misile">Missile Fire</h2>
<p>
All missile fire (bows, crossbows, slings, javelins, etc.) will be according to the table below.
</p><p>
Each player's archers must be first grouped into units.  The maximum size for a unit is 4; above this count as an additional unit.  Count the total &#35;firing of all archers in the unit (some, such as an English Longbowman, may count as more than one archer), determine the armor type of the target, and roll one AIM die on the table below.
</p>

<table style="
	text-align: center;">
<thead>
	<th style="padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px;"> tot. &#35;firing </th>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>
Die results equal to the number in the table score 1 hit against the target.  For each point above, score one additional hit against the target.
</p><p>
Mixed missile types (bows, crossbows, slings) cannot be grouped into a unit.
</p><p>
This table does not apply to artillery (arquibus, cannon, etc.).
</p>

<h2 id="skirmish">Skirmish Combat</h2>
<p>
This is the default melee system of the game, and serves as a baseline for the others.  It is the easiest system, and the fastest to resolve.  This system is best for keeping the game moving during an attack by numerous foes.
</p><p>
Skirmish combat derives from wargame rules for units of several figures fighting.  Units of troops are broken into either foot (infantry) or horse (cavalry), and further classified as light, medium, or heavy:
</p>
<table style="border: 1px solid black">
	<tr>
		<th> </th>
		<th>Foot</th>
		<th>Cavalry</th>
	</tr>
	<tr style="border: 1px solid black">
		<th> Light </th>
		<td> <b>LF</b> infantry fighting in loose formation with basic weapons and limited gear.</td>
		<td> <b>LC</b> mounted soldiers mostly used for harrying opponents.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="border: 1px solid black">
		<th> Medium </th>
		<td> <b>MF</b> infantry in closer formation with better weapons and moderate armor.</td>
		<td> <b>MC</b> mounted soldiers for direct assaults on enemy troops.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th> Heavy </th>
		<td> <b>HF</b> elite infantry units, able to withstand a cavalry charge.</td>
		<td> <b>HC</b> armored knights and shock troops to destroy enemy lines.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
In Brigandine, a unit representing a single soldier may have the fighting strength of multiple men.  The resolution of skirmish melee is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> In iniative order, each unit (the attacker) may attack one other unit (the defender) </li>
	<li> Determine the attacker's type and strength:	
		<ul>
			<li> <b>attk type</b> --- whether LF, MF, HF, LC, MC, HC </li>
			<li> <b>&#35;attk</b> --- representing the effective number of men fighting</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li> Determine the defender's type and strength:
		<ul>
			<li> <b>def type</b> --- whether LF, MF, HF, LC, MC, HC </li>
			<li> <b>&#35;def</b> --- representing the number of hits needed to land a strike</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	<li> Find cell in skirmish combat table corresponding to attacker/defender types.  This cell lists the number of dice per man that the attacker will roll, followed by the necessary result for a success.</li>
	</li>
	<li> Roll the total number of dice indicated, and count each success as a hit.  The dice rolled are according to the <b>ATK</b> stat, unless otherwise specified.</li>
	<li> IFF the defender is lower in initiative, then the defender may elect to sacrifice his upcoming attack by taking defensive action, rolling as many <b>DEF</b> dice as his remaining <b>hits</b>.  Each rolled <b>DEF</b> die can be matched to one of the attacker's rolled <b>ATK</b> dice, and if greater will negate it. </li>
	<li> Subtract remaining <b>ATK</b> dice from the defender's remaining <b>hits</b>.  If applicable, also remove defeated units.</li>
	<li> If the defender is reduced to <b>0 hits</b>, then the defender has been defeated.</li>
	<li> Continue to next attacker.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The dice rolled are the attacker's <b>ATK</b> dice.  Remember that
<a href="basic.html#exploding-dice" target="main">dice explode</a>,
so that any die is theoretically able to reach arbitrarily high values.
</p>

<h3> Defensive Action </h3>
<p>
The defender can choose to forego the next attack and use the dice instead to fend off an attacker.  The defender rolls <b>DEF</b> dice equal to his remaining <b>hits</b>, and matches each die against one of the attacker's rolled <b>ATK</b> dice.  If the <b>DEF</b> die is <i>greater</i> than the <b>ATK</b> die, then that <b>ATK</b> die is negated.  Ties do not negate.
</p><p>
The defender must be lower in initiative than the attacker (meaning the defender has not yet attacked this round).  The defender then loses any upcoming attacks for this round of combat.
</p>


<h2 id="man-to-man"> Man-to-Man Combat</h2>
<p>
Man-to-man combat in Brigandine aims to capture strategy in choice of arms and armor, the benefits of reach, and the gains and drawbacks of two-handed weapons.  This facet of combat is simulated with the to-hit matrices.
</p><p>
This combat system is more involved than skirmish combat.  As it is more dramatic, it is best suited for when the PCs comes into melee with equal or worthy opponents.
</p><p>
A bout of man-to-man combat begins when two or more combatants first move into melee range of one another.
They may move out of melee range, ending the bout.  If the same combatants meet up again, they begin a new bout of man-to-man combat.
</p><p>
The resolution of man-to-man combat is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
	<li> Determine the types and &#35;s for each combatants, same as for skirmish combat.</li>
	<li> Find the corresponding cells in the skirmish combat tables for the attack of each combatant.  The first number in each cell states the number of attacks each combatant has this combat round.</li>
	<li> For each attack as above, each combatant may make one or more blows, based on comparison of weapon ranks:
		<ul>
			<li> Four to seven ranks lower than opponent's: two blows per attack.</li>
			<li> Eight or more ranks lower than opponent's: three blows per attack.</li>
			<li> Otherwise: one blow per attack.</li>
		</ul>
		This means a combatant could strike his opponent several times in one attack.</li>
	<li> Each combatant may elect to sacrifice some of their blows to <b>parry</b> attacks (described later).</li>
	<li> For the first round in the bout, if one combatant has a weapon 2 or more ranks higher than his opponent's, then that combatant attacks first.  Otherwise, they attack in initiative order.</li>
	<li> On all subsequent rounds in the bout, if one combatants has a weapon that is 2 ranks lower than his opponent's, then that combatant attacks first.  Otherwise, use the same order as the previous round.  (A lower weapon rank could be achieved by switching to a side arm.)</li>
	<li> All blows are rolled on the </li>
</ol>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Man-to-man combat in Brigandine requires rolling on to-hit matrices to determine a successful strike.  Because keeping track of tables and to-hit matrices can become an obstacle to play, I have provided several options for reducing the number of tables.

<h2 id="joust"> Jousting </h2>

<p>Coming Soon!</p>

<p>
Jousting combat is a form of dueling, fought by a series of direct charges with aimed strikes and carefuly chosen defenses.  Each combatant chooses a place to aim and a defensive stance, which will both determine the outcome when the warriors collide in combat.  There is no dice rolling in jousting.
</p><p>
It is important the jousters make their decisions in secret before the joust.  This can be as simple as the referee writing down the opponents' choices and then the player announcing the PC's choices.
</p><p>
Jousting lasts until an opponent is slain or unhorsed.  In a friendly competition, a score may be kept instead of casualties.

Some creatures are too powerful to be defeated in normal combat.  For these creatures, the only option is to engage in Fantasy Combat, the final combat system. 
</p><p>
Fantasy Combat is more abstract than the other systems.  Both parties roll, and the result of the battle is determined immediately based on this roll.  There is no initiative order; the results occur simultaneously.  Both combatants may be killed in the same roll.  It is up to the referee and other players to narrate exactly what occurred in the combat.
</p><p>
Not all humans may engage in Fantasy Combat.  Some particular warriors, after attaining legendary status on the battlefield, will have gained the experience to engage in Fantasy Combat on their own.  Otherwise, the use of a magic weapon is the only hope to fight the monsters on the Fantasy Combat tables.
</p><p>
Some monsters can be fought with either Fantasy Combat or one of the other systems.  Those that can only be fought in Fantasy Combat will have "FC only" listed for their &#35;def.
</p><p>
It may happen that PCs will be forced into combat with an "FC only" creature, with no way to destroy it.  Not all is lost.  Though the creature may not be killed, it can still be attacked and driven away.  When the monster takes simultaneous hits equal to its &#35;attk, it will be turned and will leave.  If it is further attacked while leaving, the monster will resume defending itself until the PCs are destroyed.
